# LastNext24 MVP Development Todo List

> **IMPORTANT**: Read all documentation in `/docs` (backend.md, ui.md, prd.md) to have full context before executing any tasks. This todo list follows feature-driven development with GitHub integration and Vercel hosting.

## Development Approach
- **Feature-driven development**: Each feature is developed, tested, committed, and deployed separately
- **Version control**: All changes pushed to GitHub with descriptive commits
- **Hosting**: Deployed to Vercel for live demo
- **No backend database**: Demo uses localStorage and hardcoded data only

## Remedial Tasks & Bug Fixes

### Known Issues to Address
**Status**: Pending resolution

- [ ] **Transcription Integration**: Re-enable OpenAI transcription functionality
  - Issue: TranscriptionService import commented out to fix production build
  - Solution: Uncomment import and transcription code after API key configuration
  - Location: `src/components/CreateReportModal.tsx` lines 4, 359-386
  - Dependencies: OpenAI API key in environment variables

- [ ] **Browser Navigation 404 Error**: Fix page not found when using browser back button
  - Issue: Users get 404 error when navigating back in browser history
  - Likely cause: React Router configuration or Vercel routing setup
  - Location: Routing configuration in `src/` and/or `vercel.json`
  - Impact: Poor user experience, breaks expected browser behavior

- [ ] **Production Build Optimization**: Address npm audit vulnerabilities
  - Issue: 4 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 2 high) reported during build
  - Solution: Run `npm audit fix` and test for breaking changes
  - Impact: Security and dependency management

### Future Enhancements to Consider
