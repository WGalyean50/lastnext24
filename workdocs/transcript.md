Speaker A: This is the product description for LastNext24, a platform that allows teams to provide daily updates and have them aggregate up through their hierarchy within their organization, allowing everyone to rapidly update everyone else on what's going on within the company. Here is the user flow. An individual contributor at the end of their day logs in and provides a short 3 to 5 minute verbal update on what they have accomplished that day and what they are going to do the next day that is captured by the product and transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper API. That transcription is then summarized into a few key bullet points using ChatGPT4O. When multiple people on a team have done their reports, all of those reports are then aggregated into one report and provided to their supervisor, that supervisor. So let's call them a manager. On the manager level, each manager's people across all their reports, their reports are aggregated and reported up to the manager's director. The director's reports are also aggregated for the director and those are aggregated for the vp and then the VP reports are provided to the C suite person. So let's call them like in this case for engineers. Let's call that the Chief Technology Officer. Here's what the UI should look like. It should be a clean software as a service style user interface with white and blue as the main color scheme. On the left side is a side panel that shows a few options. It has Previous reports which provides a drop down that allows the user to go in and see what their previous reports were on given days. It also has a button on the top right of every screen that says Record or Not record. It says Create new report or no, it just says New report on it. So it's a blue button on the top right that says New report. When they click that they are brought into a modal where they can provide a title for the report that is optional. They can either click Current date time or provide a specific date with optional time on it. Then there is a standard word box where they can type in their answer. Or they can hit transcribe and the microphone is turned on and then they can talk into it in order to provide their report. When the transcription is complete or when the recording is complete. The transcription is displayed inside of the composition text box so that the user can then make edits as they see fit. The idea is that the user has to make as few edits as possible because it's just their their verbal stand up at the end of each or for the end of the day. Then they can hit submit when they hit submit, it is then put into the system for aggregation up to the manager level. On the manager level, the manager can see each of inlets for a demo version of this. Let's say the manager has three direct reports. It shows of their direct reports who contributed to the most recent report and then it shows that report. The manager can then make edits to the report or additions as they see fit and then they click submit as well. There should also be an auto submission option where the user on or you know, a manager on any level can auto submit and maybe by default it should be on auto submit at 4:30 Pacific so that the submissions roll all the way up to the top. We're going to build a minimum viable product of this product. First we're going to build a demo mode. For the demo mode on the top right, there is a choice with a drop down that says choose role. And you can choose from a pick list of the following Engineer, Manager, Director, VP or cto Based off of what you choose there it shows you your view of what's going on across the organization. Wherever you are in the hierarchy, you can see everything below you within your organization. But by default you cannot see things laterally. So if you're a vp, you can see everything happening within your organization and you can see the VP report of your peer, but you cannot see the details of your peer's organization. So if you wanted to go into your peers director level reports, you can't see those, you can only see your peers full report. That dynamic plays out throughout the hierarchy. We need to create a visual of the organization that shows that maybe you know, the first version of this to keep this very easy. It's like in a, in a notes outline format. So you could have, you know, on the far left indentation the cto. And then under the CTO are the two vice presidents. Each one has a little carrot next to it that you can click to expand downward to see the next level in their organization. So then if you click that for one of the VPs, you can see their directors. Then if you click that again, you can see their managers. And if you click that again, you know, if you click each manager, you can click down to see their individual direct reports and then what their particular report of the day is. So in this outline view next to each, each person's name is, it would say like manager colon, Eric Topping. And then in quotation marks it provides their daily report. That might be in a paragraph format if that's easier to read. So you choose who you want to be and then you see all of that. The There is also a chat functionality where whoever you are in the hierarchy, you can ask questions of your entire organization. So you can say what's the status of this project? Or you can ask about a specific issue that the team was facing and then you are provided retrieved notes on the specifics based off of when you hit submit on that question. An LLM reads all of the different submissions across that node of the organization. So it goes down the hierarchy and looks at all the different submissions that everyone has made and it provides quotes from each person. It provides one an LLM generated summary and then it provides quotes from each individual showing who said what that contributed to that overall summary from the LLM. It is optional, but a manager can also provide questions that go down their organization. Actually, never mind, I don't want to put that into the MVP right now. That could be in a future iteration. I'm curious if there is easy potential for a Slack integration here. Or you could build a Slack bot that just sends you a notification in Slack that provides the summaries and where you could interact with the Slack bot directly in order to ask questions if you are one of the leaders. But that is not mandatory. For the minimum viable product, we need to persist each day's reports each day could have multiple reports in it that is fine from an individual contributor or manager or director or whoever within the hierarchy. On the left side is a sidebar that shows a few options. It shows yesterday's report, last week's reports, or chose reports from last 10 business days. And then it shows previous reports. So each one of these is an option with a little caret next to it. And when you click the caret, the caret rotates downwards and then it shows the entries beneath it so that way you can expand and collapse them as you need to. For navigation, reports are persisted by default, so they need to be saved for now. For the minimum viable product, reports do not need to be saved. Instead, we're going to what we're going to do is we're going to create an organization that looks like this. There's one chief Technology officer. There are two vice presidents. Each vice president has two directors that report to them. Each director has two managers who report to them. Each manager has three engineers who report to them. For each one of those individual engineers across the organization, you're going to generate static reports. We're going to have the LLM wants upon creation of this project. Actually, no, we're just going to have Claude code generate the transcription, this fake dummy placeholder transcription for each individual contributor. So then when whatever you select in the hierarchy. Oh, and one of the individuals has if you choose individual contributor or I mean whoever you choose in the hierarchy because this is a demo, whoever you choose, you can both see the report for your own organization based off of everyone under you. You can edit it via text and you can also record your own version as well if you want to. The overall purpose of this product is to provide rapid organization wide communication and collapse a lot of the human hierarchy reporting slowness and filtering that happens that so often creates heavily skewed or diluted reports up to the top of management. So whoever you are, you have selected for the drop down of choose your role then you can when you go into the the org, we're going to call it the Org View O R G org Org View. That's where you see the text outline format where it shows cto, vp, Director, Manager, Engineer. When you go into that you can click Generate Report and that's where the LLM will live. Retrieve the contents of that specific branch of the organization and summarize them and provide them to you. Provide you the summary. We need to come up with a fictional project that each manager's team is working on. I want Claude code to figure out what that project should be. So that way we have a portfolio of projects to report on upwards through the chain of command. So we're going to use GPT4O for the aggregation and we're going to use OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription. That is going to be the LLM that we use. Going to use a React front end. Everything's going to be written in Python. We're going to use Supabase. We're not going to include single sign in or anything like that in the mvp. We can put that in later. And we're going to use GitHub and Vercel for hosting. The product is called LastNext24. Also the text box. The prompt for the text box says what did you do today? What will you do tomorrow? Question mark. Also for a leader level, whether you are a manager, director, VP or cto, in your view, you see you get provided your org level roll up of all the different reports. There is a To the right of that is a chat interface where you can ask questions of the of the organization's reports. There are also buttons where you can click what time frame you want to see the what time frame you want it to report on whether it was today yesterday, last week, or last month. Those should be the options. We can add in more options later. The opening page should be a homepage that says that has the product's title last next 24. It says rapid Reporting Made Easy. And then there is a blue button under that that says Enter Demo Version. When you click Enter Demo Version, it takes you to the core product experience and that is where you choose your role on the top. And then from there you can record your report. And then of course, then you see everything on the left side on the sidebar.
