# Claude Instructions for LastNext24

## Project Context
LastNext24 is a hierarchical reporting platform MVP that allows teams to provide daily updates that aggregate up through organizational hierarchies.

## Required Reading
**IMPORTANT**: Before starting any task, always read all files in `/docs/` for complete context. This ensures you understand the full project scope and requirements.

Current documentation includes:
- `/docs/backend.md` - Backend architecture and requirements
- `/docs/todo.md` - Detailed development task list and progress tracking

## Development Guidelines
- This is an MVP, not an enterprise product - keep solutions simple
- Use static demo data rather than complex dynamic systems
- Focus on core functionality over scalability features
- Prioritize working demo over production-ready code
- **Task Completion Protocol**: After completing any task from `todo.md`, always update both `todo.md` (mark task as completed) and `CLAUDE.md` (update progress status) to maintain accurate project tracking
